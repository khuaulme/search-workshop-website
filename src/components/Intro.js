          This workshop is broken down into different lessons. In Lessons 1-5,
          you will get up and running by building out the basic Netflix clone.
          We start getting fancy in Lessons 6 and 7 by building out more complex
          queries and playing with the score modifiers. The later lessons can
          all stand on their own. So you can start from the absolute beginning
          or jump directly to the more advanced features. The frontend
          application is hosted on GitHub and CodeSandbox.io and sits ready for
          you to fork.
