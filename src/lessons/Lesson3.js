              Now that we have the heart of our movie search engine in the form
              of an aggregation pipeline, how will we use it in an application?

              <br></br>There are lots of ways to do this, but I found the
              easiest was to simply create a RESTful API to expose this data -
              and for that, I leveraged MongoDB's Atlas App Services. App
              Services is a serverless platform offering a trunk full of app
              developer building blocks to help make working with data as easy
              as possible.
